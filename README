 ======================================

This is my first CodeIgniter Project, it's a minimalist blog engine, a little
too minimalist at the moment, but it's going to evolve slowly.

It's intended to be user for a personal blog with one blog writer, thus the
excessive simplicity.

At the moment, there is just the PHP and the HTML. I will add the styling as
soon as possible.

NOTE: To create a new user for the first time I created a temporary
"method" (for now):

Just point your browser to {base_url()}/user/signup
ie: http://localhost/cimble/user/signup

This will create the following user:

	email    :  admin@admin.com
	password :  admin
