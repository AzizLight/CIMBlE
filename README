 ======================================

This is my first CodeIgniter Project, it's a minimalist blog engine, a little
too minimalist at the moment, but it's going to evolve slowly.

It's intended to be user for a personal blog with one blog writer, thus the
excessive simplicity.

At the moment, there is just the PHP and the HTML. I will add the styling as
soon as possible.

NOTE: To create a new user for the first time I created a temporary
"method" (for now):

Just point your browser to {base_url()}/user/signup
ie: http://localhost/cimble/user/signup

This will create the following user:

  email    :  admin
  password :  admin

EDIT: There is now a link on every page to add a new user. It will add the
same user everytime. This will be soon replaced by a simple install.php file
that will be run to create the first user only.

After the first time, you can add users from the dashboard, but you
need to be logged in. Registrations are not open to the public, and will
probably never be.

I have rewritten the whole application. It is now cleaner, better commented,
and it uses my new authentication library, Azauth.
